1.client -> 2.browser(chrome) -> 3.server #ideal response code is 200

the backend is the server side of the website
it stores and arranges data and also makes sure everything on the client side works fine.
it is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
it is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.
